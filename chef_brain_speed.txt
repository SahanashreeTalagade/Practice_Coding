Chef and Brain Speed

In ChefLand, the speed of a human brain is measured in bits per second (bps).
Chef has a threshold limit of X bps. If his brain speed goes above this limit, his calculations become prone to errors.

Chef is currently working at Y bps.

Your task is to determine whether Chef is prone to errors or not.

Input Format

A single line containing two space-separated integers:

X — the threshold limit

Y — the current working brain speed

Output Format

Print YES if Chef is prone to errors.

Otherwise, print NO.

(The output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

Explanation

Chef is prone to errors if Y > X

Chef is not prone to errors if Y ≤ X
